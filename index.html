    <p>Angelou followed her first two installations of her autobiography, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1969) and Gather Together in My Name (1974), with Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry like Christmas, published in 1976. It marked the first time a well-known African-American woman writer had expanded her life story into a third autobiography.[1] She also published two volumes of poetry entitled Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie (1971), which was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize,[5] and Oh Pray My Wings Are Gonna Fit Me Well (1975).[a] Angelou had become recognized and highly respected as a spokesperson for Blacks and women.[7] It made her, as scholar Joanne Braxton stated, "without a doubt ... America's most visible black woman autobiographer".[8]

        Writer Hilton Als calls Angelou, along with feminist diarirst Ana√Øs Nin, "pioneers of self-exposure, willing to turn a spotlight on their own sometimes questionable exploits and emotional shortcomings.".[9] Angelou, unlike African American women autobiographers who wrote during the 19th and early 20th centuries, was able to use herself as the main character in her books.[9] Writer Julian Mayfield, who calls I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings "a work of art that eludes description",[9] states that Angelou's work set a precedent in describing "the black experience" in African American literature.[9] While Angelou was composing her second autobiography, Gather Together in My Name, she was concerned about how her readers would react to her disclosure that she had been a prostitute. Her husband Paul du Feu talked her into writing about it anyway, encouraging her to "tell the truth as a writer" and "be honest about it".[10]</p>
